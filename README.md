One of the best creators and an inspiration for many game developers has risen from his slumber and created a fantastic first Godot tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).

This repo tries to replicate the tutorial content in [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), as it is one of the best open-source engines, and it's written in Rust ðŸ¦€.

As bevy doesn't have an editor just yet, [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) was used for the level editor. Many features would technically be missing in bevy to implement all the features in the tutorial, but thanks to the incredible bevy community, there is nearly a community crate for every missing feature.

Hopefully, this repo will help as a learning resource for others and show that bevy is further along than many might think.

However, it also shows that many things, although achievable, will require a little more work compared to Godot ðŸ˜….
